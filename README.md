# CULT DAO Hub

A community-built, open-source interface for interacting with the CULT DAO ecosystem. This hub is a comprehensive, transparent, and user-friendly dashboard for all members of the DAO, from Guardians to The Many.

> The goal is to provide tools that empower the community, increase transparency, and give every member the ability to easily track and participate in the governance of the DAO.

### Features

*   **Complete Wallet Management:** Connect your wallet for a full breakdown of your CULT and dCULT holdings, delegation status, and on-chain voting rights.
*   **Seamless Staking & Rewards:** A simple, unified interface to stake CULT, unstake dCULT, and claim your accumulated rewards from DAO investments with a single click.
*   **Full DAO Governance Suite:** View active, pending, and past proposals with a powerful search and filter function. Guardians can submit new proposals, and The Many can cast their votes directly on-chain or via gasless signature.
*   **In-Depth DAO Metrics:** A detailed, real-time dashboard tracking key on-chain statistics, including token supply dynamics (total, circulating, burned), treasury value, liquidity pools, and market data.
*   **Advanced Wallet Tracking:** Add multiple Ethereum addresses or ENS names to a persistent watchlist to monitor combined holdings and delegation statusesâ€”perfect for managing your own wallets.
*   **Multi-Currency & Theme Support:** View all financial data in your preferred global currency (USD, EUR, BTC, etc.). Customize your experience with multiple visual themes and a "shuffle" mode for a unique look every time.
