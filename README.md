# CULT DAO HUB

**YOU ARE ENTERING SOVEREIGN TERRITORY.**

This is not just a website but a community-built, open-source interface for interacting directly with the CULT DAO ecosystem. This hub is a comprehensive, transparent, and user-friendly dashboard for all members of the DAO, from Guardians to The Many.

There is no middleman. No central server. No backdoors.

## 🚀 Run Locally

This frontend is designed to run easily on your local machine, with no complex setup and minimal dependencies. The hub is a static web app. It runs anywhere with a simple HTTP server.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3** must be installed.  
  - **macOS / Linux:** Usually pre-installed.  
  - **Windows:** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and check **“Add Python to PATH”** during install.  

---

### Step 1: Get the Code
1. Click the green **Code** button on this repository.  
2. Select **Download ZIP**.  
3. Unzip the file (e.g. `hub-main.zip`) on your computer.  

---

### Step 2: Open a Terminal
- **macOS / Linux:** Open **Terminal**.  
- **Windows:** Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**.  

---

### Step 3: Navigate to the Folder
Type `cd ` (that’s c, d, and a space) into your terminal,  
**then drag and drop the unzipped `hub-main` folder into the terminal window**.  
Press **Enter** — now your terminal is inside the project folder.  

---

### Step 4: Start the Server

**macOS / Linux**
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```bash
python -m http.server
```

Your terminal will show something like:

```
Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 …
```

### Step 5: Open in Browser


Now open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your web browser.  

Stop the server anytime with `Ctrl + C`.
